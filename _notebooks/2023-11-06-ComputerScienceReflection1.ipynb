    "## Documenting my Journey\n",
    "\n",
    "- As this was my first Computer Science course ever, the journey is definitely very rough. I experienced a lot of difficulties during the first few weeks such as running the terminal commands, understanding how they work, and overall implementing/making all the code.\n",

    "## Project: My Time Working at CodeClimbers\n",
    "\n",
    "- This project is very important, as it is worth half of my grade and took over half of my class time. I learned how to cooperate with my three teammates (Ian, Gavin, and John) in order to produce a good quality performing game! I'll be honest though, Gavin is the most hard-working out of all of us, he's able to work on the code diligently and acted as a leader. I, on the other hand, didn't know where to start half of the time and mostly worked on other stuff unrelated to coding (e.g. finding sprites, html/markdown). Looking back, I wish I could experiment more with OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) so I can understand how the code works rather than only doing it a couple of times. However, I was able to modify many objects, I just haven't done them completely by myself, but I guess that's what a team is for. Code-wise, I was able to stop the player from double-jumping (though it has some delay when free falling) and made an entire menu (which is really nice, but it is made out of html, which I don't think is considered code). Besides my \"code\" work, I was able to make some quality reflection and plans such as this one, which is nice. I found a sprite, but it is not being used. For this class, I seemed to be on the artistic side (even though I'm not much of an artist) for the project overall. I honestly wish I could work on this project so that it won't seem like I'm dragging. I'm not sure if I will be able to make it to Night at the Museum (where we showcase our work). If I could go back in time with my new-found knowledge, I could work on the code components more, but I have to think about it now. I wrapped up all of my findings, and I am going to take all of my knowledge for next trimester."
